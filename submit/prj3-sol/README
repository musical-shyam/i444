Note:
I have used 3 of my extra days for this submission, and I have completed the API route handlers and as well as the test cases altough the log doesnt match, all the test cases are running successfully

I implemented the several API routes for this project that help the working of several functionalities of the lending library system. Also implemented the missing test cases which helps us test the working of the Web services
for better understanding of the code, i have neatly arranged the code and included comments that explains most important parts of the added code
