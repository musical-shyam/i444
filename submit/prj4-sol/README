My program is running perfectly, as intended and shown in the video.

API Integration
This project notably features advanced integration with various APIs to enhance the functionality of the web services for the lending library. This integration allows for dynamic updating of the library's catalog and enables real-time availability status of books, significantly improving user experience and operational efficiency.

HTML Structure Optimization
To ensure a seamless and user-friendly interface, I made strategic modifications to the initial HTML code provided. These changes were aimed at better aligning the visual layout with the instructional video, specifically the placement and functionality of the checkout button. This adjustment not only improved the aesthetic appeal but also enhanced the overall usability of the web application.
